# Industrial idiocy meetings and disdcussions keep me away from being able to read equations fluently.
# I need to fetch this ability back to actually produce useful software and ML algorithm.
# I reailze I should not share any knowledge to whoever couch potato engineer, they just pretend they understand, keep nodding their head like a bobblehead doll and never produce useful software.
# So I decide to solve a math problem a day and ignore those idiots.
# Just let python choose for me.
# Yes I intentionally let those be headings.
